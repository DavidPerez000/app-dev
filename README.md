### **Main Characters**
| Name | Picture | Background |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| [Eric Cartman](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Eric_Cartman) | ![Cartman](https://i.imgur.com/9XWUNsK.png) | Cartman is sometimes the main antagonist of an episode, for example "Trapper Keeper". None of the other three main children really consider Cartman their friend and do not know why they started hanging out with him in the first place, but a certain form of unstable friendship ends up being born between them. However he is usually Kyle's first choice when he breaks his friendship with Stan. In earlier episodes, Kenny was his best friend, however, in later seasons, Butters Stotch is usually depicted as such.|
| [Kyle Broflowski](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kyle_Broflovski) | ![Kyle](https://i.imgur.com/ixuAnU0.png) | Kyle is a member of the only Jewish family in South Park. He is often noted for this, as well as his intelligence. Cartman regularly makes derogatory remarks about the Jewish people, often directly in Kyle's presence specifically to aggravate him.  |
| [Stan Marsh](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Stan_Marsh) | ![Stan](https://i.imgur.com/BQPeeN5.png) | Stan is generally the most tender and sensitive of the four boys. For example, in "Kenny Dies", he finds it difficult to see Kenny in his ill state, and in "Raisins" he becomes depressed after losing his girlfriend to [Tolkien](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tolkien_Black).  |
| [Kenny McCormick](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Kenny_McCormick) | ![Kenny](https://i.imgur.com/3PMAuNM.png) | Kenny is most famous for dying in almost every episode in the first five seasons of South Park. He is also easily recognizable for almost always wearing an orange parka, or just having his face hidden, that covers most of his face and muffles his speech. In "Mysterion Rises" Kenny, who is revealed to be the superhero Mysterion, reveals that he has the power of immortality, in a sense, and that he just wakes up in his bed after having died. He is then upset that his friends never remember him dying, and even kills himself in front of everyone to prove himself.  |
